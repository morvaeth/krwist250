      <h2>Why?!</h2>
      <p id="explaination">It is not just an occupation for me; this is a passion project that has been in the making since I was a child and will continue until that creative spark is lost. It's a continual growth of my skills, <br> but it is also fulfilling to take someone's idea and make it manifest before their eyes, being able to see that character representation of themselves and their interests in a communal game.</br></p>
      <p id="explaination">While art is subjective, it is also the product of someone's time and skill. However, burgeoning, recent technologies have allowed the possibility of generated artwork to meet someone's inputted specifications,<br> but the difference between an AI-generated image and a commissioned artist is the uniqueness and authenticity of the product. AI products are aggregated from a wide net of references, resulting in nothing more than a templated reference that cannot legally be fully owned by the creator. An artistic rendition gotten by an artist is both able to be owned by you and is something that is entirely unique to your specifications.</br></p>

      <h2>Decisions</h2>
      <p id="explaination">Whatever decision you come up with, I am here to provide the best experience for you. Where the submission decisions you need to make are large and varied, I can always help you as well.<br> The greatest privilege I have is when a customer is excited to let me expand and create on my own terms. You don’t need an answer to everything. However, if you’re on a budget and need parameters, think of these deliverables as an opportunity to create barriers. That way you can have the work you dreamt of without too much of the hassle.</br></p>
