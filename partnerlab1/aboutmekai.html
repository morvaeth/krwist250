  <h1>The Backstory of Kai Tonet</h1>

<h2>Contact information at kaiantoinett@gmail.com<h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Caloocan City, Republic of the Philippines, just north of the capital city of Manila. Since I could remember I was always trying to visualize all the ideas in my head onto paper, or admittedly on the walls of our house or the sidewalks in the neighborhood. It was always a hobby I poured my time into, until I graduated from high school and was met with a decision: enter into higher education for something that was profitable, or for something that I was passionate about. In a few short months my interest had won out, and I was enrolled in the University of the Philippines in neighboring Quezon City to study graphic design.</p>

    <p>While making my way through college, I decided to double-down on my passion and skillset and offer commissioning services for art, mostly to help with tuition costs but also to further hone my skills. While some requests came in for logo design or website art, the majority of my commissions were for TTRPG characters. It was in this way I eventually came to know Kat Thomas, who commissioned no less than five pieces of art for her various D&D characters over the freshman and sophomore years of my college education. She also went the extra step and told everyone she played with about my artwork, leading to even more commissions coming to me for characters. All this lead up to a job offer upon my graduation, resulting in my partnership with D&D D&D to facilitate the artistic commissioning of people's character ideas.</p>
