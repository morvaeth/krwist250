      <h2>Dungeons and Dragons!!</h2>
      <p id="explaination">Imagine a book, a story written by someone else with characters that are described a certain way navigating the plot in a fixed manner. The story may or may not be compelling, but what it will always be is pre-determined. However, imagine now a story that is ever-evolving with characters that are fluid in their actions and perceptions, impacted by the malleableness of the story without a current end. This style of storytelling is that of the tabletop roleplaying game genre, wherein you and however many other participants weave your individual ideas together to form the rich tapestry of a story in motion, creating something truly unique in a collaborative effort.</p>
      <p id="explaination">But lo, the vastness of narrative possibilities that are at your fingertips can leave some with decision fatigue, being overwhelmed by the sheer amount of choices that make up the foundation for a character, their backstory, their personality, et cetera. That is a challenge that my service offers to the budding, up-and-coming narrative role player.</p>
