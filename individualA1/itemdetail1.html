  <h1>The Backstory: Vena</h1>
  <p>In a small crèche, she stood out with ivory skin and pupil-less eyes of topaz. Her bestowed name was Sigrun Brunhild. Born to a peasant woman secluded within a mountain’s summit, she grew without boundaries. A feral child under the gentle guidance of Vena, her mother. Early in her life, she was raised in solitude, suffering nights of frigid winters, thin air, and little in regards to resources and food.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the night before her third birthday that she saw the third face in her life, aside from her mother’s and her own in reflections. Arriving upon a dark steed, a cloaked figure crossed through their threshold unannounced, unceremoniously breaching their tiny hut in the sky. Quiet whispers took to the night as the child seemingly slept in the makeshift bed within the rafters. By dawn, the cloaked figure had vanished, her mother prepping to follow their descent to the nearest village not long after.</p>

<p>Though she grew with strength and smile under her mother’s watchful eye, her mother’s concern was great. Before their descent, her mother turns to the tiny hut she found retreat in. Was all her efforts lost? Was she not held within the gods’ favor? She looks to the ingenue in her arms and sighs. No, it was not all lost. The gods’ eyes were on them; she knew this. Her prayers were answered that night when she saw her child bear the light of the heavens as, coalesced with the darkening night sky, her topaz eyes flashed golden, illuminating her cherubic face in her woolen swaddle.</p>

<p>Out of reach for only a moment, she had kept her safe for this long with the quiet watch of the celestials. The divine had a plan for her daughter and she would see to it that she had the right start to her journey for the gods. As if on the run, they traversed many miles nonstop without a flicker of life nearby. Rations ran dry and muscles quickly fatigued, her struggle to hold her child weakening with every passing day.</p>

<p>Despite prayers, her maintaining a life of seclusion from creatures and beasts proved impossible. The soft innocent face of her child gave her pause as she laced the shoes of her daughter. It was not long ago she had made her way up to the peaks during pregnancy as a retreat from the nightmares that ravaged her town.</p>
