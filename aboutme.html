    <h1>About Kat Thomas!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        My name is Kathrynanne, but I go by Kat and my pronouns are she/her. I grew up in Valdosta, Ga but currently reside in Japan for the past decade. I am a first year student of Penn State as an IST major with a BS in Psychology and an AS in Business management. I enjoy building computers, and keyboards as a hobby. For fun I enjoy reading, playing video games or TTRPGs or diving with my family. Fun fact about me is I have  been to more than two countries, and 43 states by the time I was 18. I've continued to move and travel since I was a child.
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I am enrolled in IST 250: Intro to Web design. I am taking this class in order to get my degree in IST or Information Science Technology. During my time in this class I have learned a lot about web design. I have learned a lot about elements, selectors, formatting, JavaScript, Css and HTML. I have much more to understand and learn but feel confident with the skills I have achieved during my time in this class. I am excited for the future and what I can do with these new tools. Hopefully from this experience I will gain more and exciting opportunities to challenge myself and sharpen my skill set.</p>
